# Mos *(Work In Progress)*

An emulator for the **Mos 6502 Processor** for use in Garry's Mod

## What is it?

The [Mos 6502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502) processor is an 8-bit microprocessor introduced in the 70s.
Commonly known for its use in old computers such as the Apple I or the Commodore PET, it was the least expensive processor of its time.

This is an emulated verison of the 6502 that you can program and run, all from within Garry's Mod.

This is still under developement and a lot of the cool features planned for it haven't been implemented yet.

## Plans for the future

Currently, you can only write assembly instructions as well as labels to help you mark specific locations of your code.  
A preprocessor is planned to be added in the near future to allow more control over the resulting compiled code such as
- Changing the location of the code
- Defining bytes directly in memory
- Defining and using macros
- Including files
