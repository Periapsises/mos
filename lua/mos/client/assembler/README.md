# The Assembler

The assembler is what takes raw source code and processes it in order to generate a binary file which the processor can execute.  
It creates all the necessary elements to go through all the required steps of compiling the code.

## The Process

When creating a new assembler, these are the steps that happen.

- Get the currently open file from the editor
- Create an assembly to hold the important data about the current program
- Start the compiler using the AST given by the parser
    - Perform the first pass to get information about addresses
    - Perform the second and final pass to generate the binary code
- Write the binary code to the output file

### Getting the main file

The first step is to get the main file, that is, the file currently open in the editor.  
This file is called `main` as it is where the entire assembly process is gonna start from.

The output file's name will be based on the main file, its extension being changed to `.bin`

### Generating an assembly

The assembly holds important information during the process of compilation.  
Initially it holds:

| Key            | Description                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `main`         | The path to the main file                        |
| `files`        | An empty list to wich to add included file paths |
| `compiler`     | The compiler object to be used                   |

Before starting, the compiler will be assigned this assembly so it can fetch the data it needs.

### Start the compiler

With the ast generated, the compiler can start converting the code into binary.

#### First pass:

The first pass calculates the position of all defined labels for use in the next step

#### Second pass:

The second pass then goes through all the code, converting it into binary form and writing it to the output file given by the compiler.

### Write the output file

The output file is then saved and closed and can be read from.

# Formated Binary Files

For performance reasons as well as to save network usage, the generated binary files follow a specific format that helps minimize their size.

## Blocks

The binary code is divided into blocks which have their own address.  
This address defines where in memory code should be loaded.

A block has the following format:

| Block address | Block size    | Block data        |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| 0x0000-0xffff | 0x0000-0xffff | Up to 65536 bytes |

For example, a block starting at address 10 and with 5 bytes written to it would look like this:

```c
0x00 0xa0 0x00 0x05 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
```

If it was followed by another block at address 2823 with 8 bytes, the result would look like this:

```c
0x00 0xa0 0x00 0x05 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x0b 0x07 0x00 0x08 0x00 0x00 0x00
0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
```

This format will really only show when the source code contains any change of address when the `.org` directive will be added.
